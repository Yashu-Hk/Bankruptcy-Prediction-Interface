# Bankruptcy Prediction Streamlit Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy for companies using machine learning models and data visualization. The application is built using Streamlit for the user interface and a set of machine learning models for classification tasks. The models are trained using various financial indicators and provide predictions that can be used for risk analysis.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess financial data, including handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) for bankruptcy prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize financial data and model results using various charts (e.g., histograms, box plots, line charts).
- **Prediction Report**: Generate a PDF report summarizing the prediction results and key metrics.
- **Bankruptcy Prediction**: Predict the bankruptcy status of a company based on user-provided data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- fpdf (for generating PDF reports)
